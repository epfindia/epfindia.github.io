**If an employee is not given the PF membership, to whom he can approach?**

**What is UAN?**

1. UAN stands for Universal Account Number to be allotted by EPFO.
2. The UAN acts as an umbrella for the multiple Member IDs allotted to an individual by different establishments.
3. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers \(Member Id\) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number.
4. This helps the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers \(Member Id\) linked to it.
5. If a member is already allotted Universal Account Number \(UAN\) then he / she is required to provide the same on joining new establishment to enable the employer to in-turn mark the new allotted Member Identification Number \(Member Id\) to the already allotted Universal Identification Number \(UAN\).
